The goal of shinysocial is to provide standardized, clean modules for collecting, displaying, and using social media information in 'shiny' apps.

## Installation

You can install the development version of shinysocial from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("shinyworks/shinysocial")
```

## Examples

There should be examples here before this package is actually published, including a link to a shiny app that demonstrates the module(s) in action.
This section will likely also be renamed to something like "Use Cases".
