<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of shinysocial is to provide standardized, clean modules for
collecting, displaying, and using social media information in ‘shiny’
apps.

## Installation

You can install the development version of shinysocial from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r4ds/shinysocial")
```

## Examples

There should be examples here before this package is actually published,
including a link to a shiny app that demonstrates the module(s) in
action. This section will likely also be renamed to something like “Use
Cases”.
